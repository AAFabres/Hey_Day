In honor of Auburn University's **Hey Day**, a tradition that celebrates community and friendliness, I've created a special script to extend a warm welcome to all. Learn more about **Hey Day** [here](https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).


# Motiviation

Every fall at Auburn University, there is a special day known as **'Hey Day'**. This tradition dates back to 1947 when it was established to honor students returning from [World War II](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii). The primary goal of Hey Day is to brighten their day and make them feel welcome after experiencing the hardships of war. This meaningful tradition has been preserved and cherished through the years, a testament to the enduring spirit of Auburn's community.
