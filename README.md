# Hey Day

In honor of Auburn University's **Hey Day**, a tradition that celebrates community and friendliness, I've created a special script to extend a warm welcome to all. Learn more about **Hey Day** [here](https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).

# Motiviation

Every fall at Auburn University, there is a special day known as **'Hey Day'**. This tradition dates back to 1947 when it was established to honor students returning from [World War II](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii). The primary goal of Hey Day is to brighten their day and make them feel welcome after experiencing the hardships of war.
